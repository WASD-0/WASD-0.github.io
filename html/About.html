                <h2><u>Our History</u></h2>
                <span class="spacer-part1"></span>
                <p>Founded in 1994 as a not-for-profit organization, the Australian Training Company initially focused on introducing structured training and employment opportunities for sports enthusiasts, promoting apprenticeships and traineeships as a pathway for life beyond sports careers. Over time, ATC expanded its group training operation to offer similar opportunities to a broader audience and developed innovative solutions to meet evolving business requirements.

                    In response to growing industry demands for customized education programs, ATC became a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) in 1998. Our training operation emphasizes flexible study arrangements and fosters an inclusive learning culture accessible to all.
                    
                    As a Group Training Company and Registered Training Organisation, ATC has made a significant impact by providing employment and training to over 20,000 apprentices, trainees, and students across the country.
